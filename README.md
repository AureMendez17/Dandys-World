Core systems

NPC system
Design goal
Keep NPC code modular. Expose behavior hooks for creators. Let designers drive behavior with simple JSON-like configs.

Main parts
- NPC factory. Spawns NPCs and registers them with the world.
- Behavior tree. Simple state machine for idle, patrol, talk, fight.
- Dialogue system. Supports multi-line text, branching choices, and quest triggers.
- Patrol routes. Waypoints you place in the editor.
- Combat hooks. Events fire on attack, damage, and death.
- Events and callbacks. Connect custom logic to standard events.

Example NPC config
- id: "shopkeeper_01"
- model: "ShopkeeperRig"
- dialogue: "shopkeeper_dialogue_01"
- patrol: false
- questLink: "find_key_01"
- spawnRadius: 2
- aggroRange: 12
- health: 200

Terrain editor
Design goal
Give a brush-based terrain editor that works with Roblox terrain and simple mesh tools for props.

Features
- Brush tool with size and intensity.
- Layer painting: grass, rock, sand, snow.
- Erosion and smooth tools.
- Flatten and raise/lower tools.
- Object scatter for props.
- Road and path generator.
- Export and import of heightmaps.

Usage pattern
- Open the plugin terrain panel.
- Create a new terrain layer.
- Use brush to paint areas.
- Scatter props to add detail.
- Use the export to save a heightmap for reuse.

Dynamic lighting
Design goal
Provide a system for time-of-day and weather. Use the Lighting service with a small abstraction layer.

Components
- Day/night cycle controller with speed and bounds.
- Ambient and skybox presets.
- Weather sequencer: clear, rain, fog.
- Light probes for dynamic areas.
- Performance toggle for mobile.

Presets
- Dawn, Day, Dusk, Night
- Storm, Rain, LightFog

How to use
- Open LightingModule in the plugin.
- Choose a preset or create one.
- Apply to the current place or save as a profile.

Quest engine
Design goal
Provide a small state machine with saveable state and hooks for complex flows.

Core concepts
- Quest: a unit with states (locked, available, active, complete).
- Task: a sub-step of a quest (collect, kill, visit, speak).
- Trigger: in-game event that advances the quest.
- Reward: items, xp, or unlocks.
- Conditions: checks that run before quest activation.

API example (pseudo)
- QuestModule.createQuest(id, data)
- QuestModule.startQuest(player, id)
- QuestModule.completeTask(player, questId, taskId)
- QuestModule.giveReward(player, questId)

Example quest flow
1. Player talks to NPC A.
2. NPC A sets quest state to active.
3. Player collects 5 items from area X.
4. QuestModule detects collection and marks task complete.
5. Player returns and speaks to NPC B.
6. QuestModule gives reward and sets quest complete.

Performance and optimization
Design goal
Keep runtime cost low. Use local scripts where possible and limit server-side heavy tasks.

Techniques used
- LOD for NPCs and props.
- Object pools for items and effects.
- Network filtering with remote event grouping.
- Batch updates for terrain changes.
- Deferred physics for heavy props.
- Culling via region checks.

Best practices
- Keep active NPC count per player low.
- Use client-side effects for visuals.
- Move heavy AI to server side only when needed.
- Reuse modules instead of cloning scripts per NPC.

API reference (core modules)
This section lists main functions and events. The release includes full API docs.

NPCModule
- NPCModule.spawn(npcConfig, position) -> npcObject
- NPCModule.despawn(npcObject)
- NPCModule.on(eventName, handler)
  - eventName: "spawned", "died", "interacted", "damaged"
- npcObject: { id, model, health, pos, interact(player) }

TerrainModule
- TerrainModule.createLayer(name, material)
- TerrainModule.paint(layer, center, radius, intensity)
- TerrainModule.flatten(area)
- TerrainModule.exportHeightmap(name)
- TerrainModule.importHeightmap(name)

LightingModule
- LightingModule.applyPreset(name)
- LightingModule.setTimeOfDay(hour)
- LightingModule.setWeather(name)
- LightingModule.on(event, handler)

QuestModule
- QuestModule.registerQuest(questId, data)
- QuestModule.start(player, questId)
- QuestModule.complete(player, questId)
- QuestModule.on(event, handler)
  - events: "questStarted", "taskComplete", "questCompleted"

UtilsModule
- UtilsModule.savePlayerData(player, key, data)
- UtilsModule.loadPlayerData(player, key)
- UtilsModule.spawnEffect(name, position)

Example workflows

Make a town
1. Create terrain base: use TerrainModule to rough out hills.
2. Use the flatten tool for a town square.
3. Scatter props: benches, lamps, crates.
4. Spawn NPCs: vendors, guards, children.
5. Set up light presets for day and night.
6. Add a central quest that sends the player to four NPCs.

Add a quest chain
1. Register quest "lost_ring".
2. Create tasks: talk to NPC1, collect item in cave, return.
3. Link NPC dialogue to quest start and completion.
4. Use QuestModule.on to listen for item collection.
5. Give rewards on completion.

Tune lighting
1. Open LightingModule.
2. Pick "Dusk" preset.
3. Adjust ambient color using the slider.
4. Use fog presets for distant haze.
5. Save preset as "TownDusk".

Spawn an NPC pack
1. Define NPC pack config with common patrol routes.
2. Call NPCModule.spawn for each entry.
3. Use object pooling for identical NPCs.
4. Attach a small AI script for group movement.

Tips for good performance
- Keep scripts small and focused.
- Avoid recursive loops that run every frame.
- Use events for state changes.
- Batch calls for remote events.
- Use LOD for meshes and textures.
- Limit particle effects in high-density zones.
- Cache references to service objects.

Customization guide
You can change assets and logic. The system uses clear hooks and config tables.

Change NPC behavior
- Open NPCModule/configs.
- Edit behavior fields: patrolSpeed, aggroRange, idleAnimation.
- Add event callbacks: onInteract, onHurt.

Add a new terrain texture
- Place a new texture file in /Assets/Textures.
- Register it in TerrainModule presets.
- Use UI to paint the new material.

Extend quest types
- Add a custom condition function.
- Register the condition with QuestModule.
- Use QuestModule.registerQuest with the new type.

Hook into events
All core modules expose on(event, handler) functions. Use these to run custom code when a state changes.

Debugging and troubleshooting
- Check the Output window in Roblox Studio for error messages.
- Use print statements during development.
- Use the sample place to compare working behavior.
- Verify module paths if the plugin fails to load.
- If an API changes between releases, check Changelog.md.
